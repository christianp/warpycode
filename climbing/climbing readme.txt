Warpy's Climbing Game!

Instructions

You have to climb up the wall. Simple, eh?
Left-click to hold on to the hold under the cursor with your left hand, and right-click to do the same with your right hand.
Hold down shift and click to move your legs.
Your left hand must always be on the left of your right hand (duh!), and you can only grab holds you can reach (also duh!)
Your legs must always be below your hips (or thereabouts :P )
The game gets harder the higher you climb...

Server
Start test.bb.. the server will just sit there nicely and not tell you anything. That's normal :)
Start climbing.bb
Enter a name and the IP "localhost". The game should start, and it should be incredibly laggy :P
