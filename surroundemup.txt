In this game, you have to create a path along the network of points.
 
You do this by left-clicking on the points connected to your current
point (THE BIG RED ONE), to move to that point.
 
BUT: You can't visit a point twice, apart from the one you started at.
SO: If you get stuck, right-click to destroy your path and start again.
 
The aim of the game is to get back to the point you started at (THE GREEN ONE).
Doing this gets you points. You get more points for a longer path,
And lots more points for enclosing other points within your path.
